### FILE OPERATIONS ###
# remove file from all folders recursively, first check than delete (attention: if you put -delete before - it will delete everything!!!)
find . -name "*.bak" -type f
find . -name "*.bak" -type f -delete
find . -name ‘\*.DS_Store’ -type f -delete

# find with Permission Denied SKIPING
find / -name "*jenkins*" 2>&1 | grep -v "Permission denied"

# pipe list of folders and remove them
ls | grep plugins | xargs rm -rf

# changed files in the last day
find /directory_path -mtime -1 -ls
find /<directory> -newermt "-24 hours" -ls

# files, folder and sizes
find /u01/elasticsearch -type f -size +1000000k -exec ls -lh {} \; | awk '{ print $9 ":" $5 }'
du -sh - check folder size
du -sh *  - check folder size
du -h - check disk space
# largest 10 directories
du -ah /* 2>/dev/null | sort -rh | head -n 10

# search trough text files
grep -rnw '/path/to/somewhere/' -e 'pattern'
example: grep -rnw . -e 'cladmin'  || grep -rnw . -e 'rdsadmin'
or
find ./ -type f -exec grep -H 'INFO' {} \;
* -r or -R is recursive,
* -n is line number, and
* -w stands for match the whole word.
* -l (lower-case L) can be added to just give the file name of matching files.
Along with these, --exclude, --include, --exclude-dir or --include-dir flags could be used for efficient searching:
* This will only search through those files which have .c or .h extensions:
grep --include=\*.{c,h} -rnw '/path/to/somewhere/' -e "pattern"
* This will exclude searching all the files ending with .o extension:
grep --exclude=*.o -rnw '/path/to/somewhere/' -e "pattern"
* Just like exclude files, it's possible to exclude/include directories through --exclude-dir and --include-dir parameter.
For example, this will exclude the dirs dir1/, dir2/ and all of them matching *.dst/:
grep --exclude-dir={dir1,dir2,*.dst} -rnw '/path/to/somewhere/' -e "pattern"
find . -name '\*MTS' -or -name '\*mp4' -or -name '\*rar' -or -name '\*pdf' -or -name '\*MTS' -or -name '\*iso' -or -name '\*MOV' -or -name '\*AVI'

# add extensions to all files
find . -type f -exec mv '{}' '{}'.jpg \;

# continuous grepping of log files
tail -f <file> | grep pattern

# remove extensions from files in folder
find . -type f -name '*.md' | while read f; do mv "$f" "${f%.txt}"; done

!blah:p – print out the command that !blah would run (also adds it as the latest command in the command history)
!$ – the last word of the previous command (same as Alt + .)
!$:p – print out the word that !$ would substitute
!* – the previous command except for the last word (e.g. if you type ‘find some_file.txt /‘, then !* would give you ‘find some_file.txt‘)
!*:p – print out what !* would substitute
